Homeland Insecurity is a series of short films that will unravel some of your preconceptions of the country along the Eastern Mediterranean known to many as Palestine and Israel.

Our country is full of ancient heritage, deep culture and complex politics that we enjoy showcasing to visitors. We love this place and have a dream of expanding democratic values and human rights. Join us for an interesting hour of film and conversation.
